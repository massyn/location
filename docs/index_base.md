# Location Database

The location database is a community driven, open source location database that can be used in applications that require some sort of GPS-to-location lookup service.

The data is free and open to anyone.  It may not be fully accurate, and that's where you come in.  If you find a location is missing, you're welcome to contibute, and add your location to the database.

## How to use the API

You can use the [location](https://github.com/massyn/location/blob/main/tools/location.py) Python class as a wrapper to retrieve the data.  When the data set becomes too large, this class will handle pagination and any updates to the API call.

## How to contribute

The database is all in [Github](https://github.com/massyn/location).  Like all github projects, you're invited to make updates, and submit a pull request to have your updates applied.  Refer to the [contribute](contribute.md) page for more information.

## Data files

The data files are produced in a number of different formats.  Pick the one that matches your requirements the closest.
